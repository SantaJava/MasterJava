so when you fill an array in reverse it's quite easy, you fill it from the back
--------------------- Example -------------------------
arr = [1, 2, ,] // because the last 2 haven't been done yet
stringarray = [ , , 2, 1] // Because only the last 2 have been done

so when you say output
arr[1] = 2
stringarray[1] = unknown because not set yet

------------------------ Solution ----------------------
make a second loop just to output the reverse array
